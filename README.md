# Pong Clone!

## Play Pong Clone
[Play Pong Clone](http://christianwood.net/labs/pong/)

Use the WASD keys for movement against the AI.
In multiplayer, Player 2 uses the arrow keys.

## Background

In the process of writing a framework for HTML canvas animations, I
realized I could use the same architecture to create a game. Thus, Pong Clone.

## Architecture
This early diagram illustrates the basic relationships between classes in the game. Not all class data are represented here.
